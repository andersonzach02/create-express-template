# create-express-api-template 📦

This is an npm package that I've created that will clone my express-api-template repo into any project to provide a ready to use API template to start creating an express API.

## TODO

- [x] Test the project to make sure that it works properly. 🧪

- [x] Configure package.json correctly to run script

- [x] Publish the package to npm. 📕
