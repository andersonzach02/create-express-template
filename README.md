# create-express-template 📦

This is an npm package that I've created that will clone my express-api-template repo into any project to provide a ready to use API template to start creating an express API.

## TODO

- [ ] Figure out how to use node to run terminal commands that will clone the express-api-template repo. ⌨️

- [ ] Maybe take this opportunity to learn about writing some tests and to test the project. 🔬

- [ ] Test the project to make sure that it works properly. 🧪

- [ ] Publish the package to npm. 📕
